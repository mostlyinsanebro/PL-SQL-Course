FOR i in lb..ub LOOP
    -- Code
END LOOP;

-- Notes :-
-- LB(Lower Bound must be smaller than or equal to Ub Upper Bound), If you want to run the loop in reverse order, just do FOR i in REVERSE 1..3....
-- Bound can not be null
-- We can not reach the counter outside of the loop.
-- We can not assign any value directly to the counter.
