PL/SQL is not an output languauge by default. If we want to output something o the screen, we need to use put_line() procedure of the DBMS_OUTPUT in-built package.

This much is also not enough for seeing the outputs, we also need to do 'SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;' for setting the output of the server on so that we can see what we are trying to print using
the dbms_output.put_line() procedure.

Code:-
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
BEGIN
dbms_output.put_line('Hello World');
END;


Nested Blocks:- Blocks within blocks

Code:-
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
BEGIN
dbms_output.put_line('Hello World');

    -- Nested Block
    BEGIN
        dbms_output.put_line('PL/SQL');
    END;
END;
