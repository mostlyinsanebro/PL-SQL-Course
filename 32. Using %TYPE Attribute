 %type is used to addign the data types of a variables or a column of a table to the variable we declare useing it.
 USE CASE:- If we have a variable that we have declared and we use in our code and it is fetching data from a column of a table and we have used exactly the same data
 type for declaring it,then if the referenced column's data type changes and a bigger value comes in it, it will cause issues.

 Use %type for declaring the variables, then as soon as the column's data type is changed, when our code runs, it will not cause any issues, as the %type will fetch the newly
 changed data type from the table colum



Code:- 
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE

    v_seg  mtl_system_items_b.segment1%type;
    v_seg1 v_seg%TYPE;
BEGIN
    v_seg := '123456789';
    v_seg1 :='987654321';
    dbms_output.put_line(v_seg);
    dbms_output.put_line(v_seg1);
END;


O/P :-
123456789
987654321


NOTE:- %type copies only the datatype and not values

CODE:-
DECLARE

    v_seg  mtl_system_items_b.segment1%type;
    v_seg1 v_seg%TYPE;
BEGIN
    v_seg := '123456789';
    v_seg1 :=NULL;
    dbms_output.put_line(v_seg);
    dbms_output.put_line(v_seg1||'HELLO');
END;

O/P :- 
123456789
HELLO
