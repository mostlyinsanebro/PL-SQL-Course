We can see the PL/SQL Architecture as 2 architectures:-

1. Physical Architecture:- In this architecture, upon executing a PL/SQL Code, the PL/SQL engine checks if there is any SQL Code written in it, it sends that DML code to the SQL engine
and that code is executed in the SQL engine in the SQL Statement Executor, the result is returned to the PL/SQL engine and then the PL/SQL code is executed on the result in the PL/SQL 
execution block and the result is retured to the client. The switching of engines is known as Context Switch.

2. Logical Architecture:- 
  i). PL/SQL cooperates with SQL Engine.
  ii). Enables Subprograms i.e. enables code reusability.
  iii). PL/SQL enables us to create and execute Dynamic Queries.
  iv). PL-SQL is case insensitive.
  v). PL-SQL has it's own optimiser.
  vi). Enables Object-Oriented Programming.
  vii). We can also use PL/SQL toolkits to create Web applications.
