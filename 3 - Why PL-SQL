PL SQL stands for Procedural SQL.

PL-SQL is not an Object Oriented Language like Java and neither is it a Visual language meaning it can not be used to create visual things but it is strictly a data manipulation languauge
which works tightly with Oracle SQL for that cause.

If we have Oracle Database installed in our system, we can automatically use Oracle SQL there and thus also us PL-SQL.

PL-SQL is strongly bound with Oracle SQL as they are both run on the database engine only, thus there is very less network loss and thus PL-SQL has very high performance. 
That is why we should use it.

It also provides a lot of Built-in functions for writing data to files, file manipulation etc. which is very helpful.
