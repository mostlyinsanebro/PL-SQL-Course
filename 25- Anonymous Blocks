In PL/SQL there are 3 types of blocks:-
1. Anonymous blocks -> unnamed blocks, can't be saved and called in the database.
2. Procedures -> named blocks, can be saved and run again and again in the database, can take in some parameters and also give out some parameters. It is not mandatory for procedures
                 to return some values.
3. Functions -> named blocks, can be saved and run again and again in the database. They must return some value, that is how they are different from procedures.

Anonymous blocks has the following sections:-

  DECLARE (not mandatory, all the variables that are to be used in our BEGIN section must be declared here, can also be left empty)
  BEGIN (madatory section)
  EXCEPTION (used to handle any run-time exceptions)
  END; (used to end the anonymous block)

Code:-
DECLARE
BEGIN
NULL;
END;
